## Vivekraj V. K.

I am a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), IIT Roorkee, advised by Prof. R. Balasubramanian and Prof. Debashis Sen (IIT Kharagpur). My research interests include video analysis and video processing applications. I studied B.E (CSE) and M.Tech (Computer Engineering) from Visvesvaraiah Technological University, Belgaum (Karnataka) in the year 2007 and 2012 respectively.

```Video skimming is a process of generating a shorter yet fully comprehensible version of a given video as its dynamic summary. A generic skimming system involves division of the video into segments and selecting the segments based on their suitability. The suitability is often obtained considering various features of the video and combining their individual contributions. Suggesting that the combination causes loss of information, we propose collective representation of the individual contributions in the form of a vector and use vector reduced (R)-ordering to judge the suitability. R-ordering based tree-structured organization and similarity levels of the video segments are employed to determine the suitability. Comparing with user generated summaries, we show that a video summary generated by a general skimming approach using R-ordering will be more effective in covering the important parts of a given video than when a feature combination is used.```

``` Video skimming is the generation of a shorter video as a summary for any given video, containing a subset of its segments that are sufficient to convey its purpose. User videos, which are often almost structureless, do not have any predefined script or events to help in summarization. Use of multiple modalities with a proper fusion strategy would be beneficial for skimming of such videos. In this paper, first, r(educed)-ordering based importance ranking of video segments is performed on audio and visual channels independently. A round robin based fusion scheme is proposed for combining importance ranks generated considering multiple modalities, and applied on the importance ranks from audio and visual channels. The fused rank is then used to generate the video summary. Experimental results show that the proposed fusion scheme outperforms relevant low level fusion and single modality cases, when r-ordering-based and other schemes are used for importance determination in each modality. ```

```Video skimming, also known as dynamic video summarization, generates a temporally abridged version of a given video. Skimming can be achieved by identifying significant components either in uni-modal or multi-modal features extracted from the video. Being dynamic in nature, video skimming, through temporal connectivity, allows better understanding of the video from its summary. Having this obvious advantage, recently,video skimming has drawn the focus of many researchers benefiting from the easy availability of the required computing resources. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey on video skimming focusing on the substantial amount of literature from the past decade. We present a taxonomy of video skimming approaches and discuss their evolution highlighting key advances. We also provide a study on the components required for the evaluation of a video skimming performance.```
